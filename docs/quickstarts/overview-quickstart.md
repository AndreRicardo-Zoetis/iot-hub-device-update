# Azure Device Update Documentation

Learn how to use Azure Device Update (ADU) to publish and manage update content to Internet of Things (IoT) devices.  Tutorials, API references, videos and other documentation help you deploy reliable and secure updates between IoT devices and IoT Hub.  

The following documentation will guide you through the three main areas in getting started Azure Device Update service.

## Getting Started - Image-based Updating

To get started using ADU you'll need to ensure your devices are running the ADU Agent. For simplicity, we have provided pre-built images and binaries for a quick and easy demonstration of the ADU product.  You will need either a Raspberry Pi 3 B+ or Ubuntu 18.04 x64, depending on whether you'd prefer using a device or simulator.

## Getting Started - Package-based Updating

To get started using ADU you'll need to ensure your devices are running the ADU Agent. We have provided a package-based agent that you can install on your device to exercise the end-to-end updating capabilities of ADU. You will need an IoT device or Azure IoT Edge device running Ubuntu Server 18.04 x64.
