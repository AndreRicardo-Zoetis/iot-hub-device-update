# Azure Device Update Resource Management

To get started with Device Update you will need to create a Device Update account, instance and set access control roles. If you have already been participating in the Device Update Preview, you can skip ahead to the "Configure IoT hub" and "Configure access control roles" below.

## Device Update Account and Instances

A Device Update account is a resource that is created within your Azure subscription. At the Device Update account level, you can select the region where your Device Update account will be created and set permissions to authorize users that will have access to Device Update.

After an account has been created, a Device Update instance must be created. An instance is a logical container that contains updates and deployments associated with a specific IoT hub. Device Update uses IoT hub as a device directory, and a communication channel with devices. For Private Preview, a single Device update account can be created per subscription, and two device update instances can be created with an account.

### Create a Device Update Account - New Preview Customers

1. Go to [Device Update Accounts](https://portal.azure.com/?microsoft_azure_marketplace_ItemHideKey=Microsoft_Azure_ADUHidden#blade/HubsExtension/BrowseResource/resourceType/Microsoft.DeviceUpdate%2FAccounts) in Azure Resource Marketplace 
2. Click Add
3. Specify the Azure Subscription to be associated with your Device Update Account and Resource Group
4. Specify a Name and Location for your Device Update Account
5. Review the details and then select "Create"

### Create a Device Update Instance - New Preview Customers

An instance of Device Update is associated with a single IoT hub. Select the IoT hub that will be used with Device Update. We will create a new Shared Access policy during this step to ensure Device Update uses only the required permissions to work with IoT Hub (registry write and service connect) and access is only limited to Device Update.

To create a Device Update instance after an account has been created.

1. Go to the Instance Management "Instances" page
2. Specify an instance name and select the IoT Hub
3. Click "Create"

### Configure IoT Hub - All Preview Customers

In order for Device Update to receive change notifications from IoT Hub, Device Update integrates with the "Built-In" Event Hub. Message routes will need to be configured if you are new to the preview or updated if you have been participating in the Device Update Private Preview. We will also update the Shared Access policy if this is not configured correctly.

To configure IoT Hub

1. Go to the Instance Management "Instances" page
2. Select the Instance that has been created for you and then click "Configure IoT Hub"
3. Select "I agree to make these changes"
4. Click "Update"

#### Message Routes that are configured

|   Route Name    | Routing Query  | Description  |
| :--------- | :---- |:---- |
|  DeviceUpdate.DigitalTwinChanges | true |Listens for Digital Twin Changes Events  |
|  DeviceUpdate.DeviceLifeCycle | opType = 'deleteDeviceIdentity'  | Listens for Devices that have been deleted |
|  DeviceUpdate.TelemetryModelInformation | iothub-interface-id = "urn:azureiot:ModelDiscovery:ModelInformation:1 | Listens for new devices types |
|  DeviceUpdate.DeviceTwinEvents| (opType = 'updateTwin' OR opType = 'replaceTwin') AND IS_DEFINED($body.tags.ADUGroup) | Listens for new Device Update Groups |

### Configure access control roles - All Preview Customers

In order for other users to have access to Device Update, users must be granted access to this resource. Here are the roles that are supported by Device Update

|   Role Name   | Description  |
| :--------- | :---- |
|  Device Update Administrator | Has access to all device update resources  |
|  Device Update Reader| Can view all updates and deployments |
|  Device Update Content Administrator | Can view, import, and delete updates  |
|  Device Update Content Reader | Can view updates  |
|  Device Update Deployments Administrator | Can manage deployment of updates to devices|
|  Device Update Deployments Reader| Can view deployments of updates to devices |

A combination of roles can be used to provide the right level of access, for example a developer can import and manage updates using the Device Update Content Administrator role, but can view the progress of an update using the Device Update Deployments Reader role. Conversely, a solution operator can have the Device Update Reader role to view all updates, but can use the Device Update Deployments Administrator role to deploy a specific update to devices.

#### To set the Access Control Policy

1. Go to Access control (IAM)
2. Click "Add" within "Add a role assignment"
3. For "Select a Role", select "Device Update Administrator"
4. Assign access to a user or Azure AD group
5. Click Save
6. You can now go to IoT Hub and go to Device Update
